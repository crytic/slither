Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses. Slither enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comphrehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses.

## Features

* Detects vulnerable Solidity code with low false positives
  * Detection of most major smart contract vulnerabilities
  * Detection of poor coding practices
* Identifies where the error condition occurs in the source code
* Easy integration into continuous integration pipelines
* Four built-in 'printers' quickly report crucial contract information
* Detector API to write custom analyses in Python
* Ability to analyze contracts written with Solidity > 0.4

Support for advanced value- and taint-tracking is [coming soon](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/issues/6)!

## Usage

``` 
$ slither tests/uninitialized.sol
[..]
INFO:Detectors:Uninitialized state variables in tests/uninitialized.sol, Contract: Uninitialized, Vars: destination, Used in ['transfer']
[..]
``` 

If Slither is run on a directory, it will run on every `.sol` file of the directory. All vulnerability checks are run by default.

###  Configuration

* `--solc SOLC`: Path to `solc` (default 'solc')
* `--solc-args SOLC_ARGS`: Add custom solc arguments. `SOLC_ARGS` can contain multiple arguments
* `--disable-solc-warnings`: Do not print solc warnings
* `--solc-ast`: Use the solc AST file as input (`solc file.sol --ast-json > file.ast.json`)
* `--json FILE`: Export results as JSON
* `--exclude-name`: Excludes the detector `name` from analysis

### Printers

* `--printer-summary`: Print a summary of the contracts
* `--printer-quick-summary`: Print a quick summary of the contracts
* `--printer-inheritance`: Print the inheritance graph
* `--printer-vars-and-auth`: Print the variables written and the check on `msg.sender` of each function

## Checks available

By default, all the checks are run.

Check | Purpose | Impact | Confidence
--- | --- | --- | ---
`--detect-uninitialized-state`| Detect uninitialized state variables | High | High
`--detect-uninitialized-storage`| Detect uninitialized storage variables | High | High
`--detect-reentrancy`| Detect if different pragma directives are used | High | Medium
`--detect-tx-origin`| Detect dangerous usage of `tx.origin` | Medium | Medium
`--detect-pragma`| Detect if different pragma directives are used | Informational | High
`--detect-solc-version`| Detect if an old version of Solidity is used (<0.4.23) | Informational | High

## How to install

Slither requires Python 3.6+ and [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/), the Solidity compiler.
<!--- 
## Using Pip

```
$ pip install slither-analyzer
```

or
-->

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/trailofbits/slither.git & cd slither
$ python setup.py install 
```
