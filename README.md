Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework written in Python 3. It runs a suite of vulnerability detectors, prints visual information about contract details, and provides an API to easily write custom analyses. Slither enables developers to find vulnerabilities, enhance their code comprehension, and quickly prototype custom analyses.

## Features

* Detects vulnerable Solidity code with low false positives
* Identifies where the error condition occurs in the source code
* Easily integrates into continuous integration and Truffle builds
* Built-in 'printers' quickly report crucial contract information
* Detector API to write custom analyses in Python
* Ability to analyze contracts written with Solidity >= 0.4
* Intermediate representation ([SlithIR](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/SlithIR)) enables simple, high-precision analyses
* Correctly parses 99.9% of all public Solidity code
* Average execution time of less than 1 second per contract


## Bugs and Optimizations Detection

Run Slither on a Truffle/Embark/Dapp/Etherlime application:
```
slither .
```

Run Slither on a single file:
``` 
$ slither tests/uninitialized.sol 
``` 

For additional configuration, see the [usage](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Usage) documentation. 

Use [solc-select](https://github.com/crytic/solc-select) if your contracts require older versions of solc.

### Detectors



Slither has more than 30 public detectors, including:
- `shadowing-state`: [State variables shadowing](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#state-variable-shadowing)
- `reentrancy-eth`: [Reentrancy vulnerabilities](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#reentrancy-vulnerabilities)
- `erc20-interface`: [Incorrect ERC20 interfaces](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#incorrect-erc20-interface)
- `incorrect-equality`: [Dangerous strict equalities](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#dangerous-strict-equalities)
- `constable-states`: [State variables that could be declared constant](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#state-variables-that-could-be-declared-constant)

See the [Detectors Documentation](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation) for the complete list.
By default, all the detectors are run.

## Printers

### Quick Review Printers
- `human-summary`: [Print a human-readable summary of the contracts](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#human-summary)
- `inheritance-graph`: [Export the inheritance graph of each contract to a dot file](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#inheritance-graph)
- `contract-summary`: [Print a summary of the contracts](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#contract-summary)

### In-Depth Review Printers
- `call-graph`: [Export the call-graph of the contracts to a dot file](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#call-graph)
- `cfg`: [Export the CFG of each functions](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#cfg)
- `function-summary`: [Print a summary of the functions](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation#function-summary)

To run a printer, use `--print` and a comma-separated list of printers.

See the [Printer documentation](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Printer-documentation) for the complete lists.

## How to install

Slither requires Python 3.6+ and [solc](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/), the Solidity compiler. 

### Using Pip

```
$ pip install slither-analyzer
```
For MacOS

```
$ pip3 install slither-analyzer
```

### Using Git

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/crytic/slither.git && cd slither
$ python setup.py install 
```

We recommend using an Python virtual environment, as detailed in the [Developer Installation Instructions](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither/wiki/Developer-installation), if you prefer to install Slither via git.

### Using Docker

Use the [`eth-security-toolbox`](https://github.com/trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox/) docker image. It includes all of our security tools and every major version of Solidity in a single image. `/home/share` will be mounted to `/share`  in the container. 

```
docker pull trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
```

To share a directory in the container:

```
docker run -it -v /home/share:/share trailofbits/eth-security-toolbox
```
