Reinitializer (tests/e2e/detectors/test_data/unprotected-upgrade/0.4.25/Reinitializer.sol#3-15) is an upgradeable contract that does not protect its initialize functions: Reinitializer.initialize() (tests/e2e/detectors/test_data/unprotected-upgrade/0.4.25/Reinitializer.sol#6-9). Anyone can delete the contract with: Reinitializer.kill() (tests/e2e/detectors/test_data/unprotected-upgrade/0.4.25/Reinitializer.sol#11-14)
