# Interval Analysis Limitations

## Computed Constants in Non-Linear Operations

When using a computed constant (e.g., `x * (-2)` where `-2` is `TMP = 0 - 2`) in multiplication or division, the variable's range is not narrowed optimally. The result range is correct, but the input variable retains its full type range.

**Cause:** Z3's overflow predicates don't back-propagate through non-linear constraints when both operands are SMT variables.

**Fix:** Detect grounded operands and add explicit bounds.
