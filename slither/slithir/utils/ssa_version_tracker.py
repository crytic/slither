class StateVarDefRecorder:
    """
    Captures information about StateVariable definitions at different points in a function
    are current at different stages for a function.

    Overview of the idea:
    For a StateVariable, sv, its current SSA-defs at end of function (including return
    statements) is recorded. Before any call the SSA-defs for sv is also recorded. Then,
    to populate the phi-nodes at entry the following rvalues are used:

    sv_1 = phi(sv_0, Union(SSA-defs at function exit), Union(SSA-defs before all calls)

    This records the three states a StateVariable can be in at function entry:
    1. Uninitialized (sv_0)
    2. Whatever states some other function writing to it left it in
    3. For reentrant calls, the state before the call for any call

    If a function uses sv after a call, a phi node is placed after call:

    sv_n = phi(sv_n-1, Union(Union(SSA-defs at function exit))

    This records the two states a StateVariable can be in after the call
    1. The state before the call (no change when invoking function)
    2. Some other function completed and modified the state, hence any exit state
