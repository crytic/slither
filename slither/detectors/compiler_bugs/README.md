# Solidity Compiler Functionality and Memory Safety Vulnerabilities Detectors

This category includes detectors that are designed to identify potential issues related to the functionality and memory safety of smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language. 
These detectors check for passing arrays located in memory to functions which expect to modify them via storage references, dangerous conversions to enums, multiple constructors in the same contract, state variables that are initialized from an immediate function call, same base constructor is called with arguments from two different locations in the same inheritance hierarchy, and also checks for ABIEncoderV2 array bugs and uninitialized function pointer calls in constructors and also detects all nodes with storage-allocated signed integer array init/assignment. These detectors help identify potential issues with the functionality and memory safety of smart contract code and assist in adhering to best practices for smart contract development.
