# Solidity Contract Logic and Syntax Vulnerabilities Detectors

This category includes detectors that are designed to identify specific vulnerabilities and issues related to the logic, syntax and style in smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language. 
These detectors check for Direct assignment of an array's length, use of assembly, incorrect use of assert(), comparison to Boolean constants, misuse of Boolean constant, calls inside a loop, use of delegatecall or callcode, costly operations inside a loop, use of deprecated standards, use of integer division before multiplication, use of strict equalities, delete in a structure containing a mapping, use of msg.value inside a loop, use of redundant statements, use of large literals, tx.origin-based protection, logic contract that can be destructed, expressions that are tautologies or contradictions, unary expressions, variables that are written but never read and written again. They help identify potential logic and syntax vulnerabilities, ensuring best practices for style and readability and assist in adhering to best practices for secure smart contract development.
