# Solidity Contract Functions Security and Vulnerabilities Detectors

This category includes detectors that are designed to identify potential vulnerabilities and issues related to the functionality and security of smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language. 
These detectors check for functions that send Ether to arbitrary destinations, use of Codex to find vulnerabilities, dead-code, public functions that could be declared as external, incorrect modifiers that do not execute or revert, ERC20 tokens that have a function whose signature collides with EIP-2612's DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, unprotected variables that are marked protected, unprotected calls to functions executing selfdestruct/suicide and also detects functions that are not implemented on derived-most contracts. These detectors help identify potential security vulnerabilities and assist in adhering to best practices for secure smart contract development.
