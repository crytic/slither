    WIKI_RECOMMENDATION = "To mitigate DOS vulnerabilities, developers should carefully analyze their contract's public functions and ensure that they are optimized to handle potential attacks. Functions that are not intended to be called externally should be declared as `internal` or `private`, and critical functions should implement gas limits or use mechanisms such as rate limiting to prevent abuse."
