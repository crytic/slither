# Solidity Contract Symbol and Variable Shadowing Vulnerabilities Detectors

This category includes detectors that are designed to identify specific vulnerabilities and issues related to the symbol and variable shadowing in smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language. 
These detectors check for state variables shadowed from abstract contracts, shadowing of built-in symbols using local variables, state variables, functions, modifiers, or events, Helper function that returns true if a variable is a gap variable used, Detection of shadowing using local variables and Detection of state variables shadowed. They help in identifying potential symbol and variable shadowing vulnerabilities and assist in adhering to best practices for secure smart contract development.
