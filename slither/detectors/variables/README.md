# Solidity Contract Variable Initialization and Usage Optimization Detectors

This category includes detectors that are designed to identify specific vulnerabilities and issues related to the initialization and usage of variables in smart contracts written in the Solidity programming language. 
These detectors check for the immediate initialization of state variables through function calls that are not pure/constant, or that use non-constant state variables, the possible use of a variable before the declaration is stepped over, detect variables with similar names, uninitialized local and state variables, uninitialized storage variables that may act as a reference to the first state variable and can override a critical variable, Unused state variable and contract reads its own variable using this, adding overhead of an unnecessary STATICCALL. They help identify potential vulnerabilities related to the initialization and usage of variables and assist in adhering to best practices for secure smart contract development.
