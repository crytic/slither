## Usage

```
slither-check-upgradeability project ContractName
```

- `project` can be a Solidity file, or a platform (truffle/embark/..) directory

### Contract V2

If you want to check the contract and its update, use:

- `--new-contract-name ContractName`
- `--new-contract-filename contract_project`

`--new-contract-filename` is not needed if the new contract is in the same codebase than the original one.

### Proxy

If you want to check also the proxy, use:

- `--proxy-name ProxyName`
- `--proxy-filename proxy_project`

`--proxy-filename` is not needed if the proxy is in the same codebase than the targeted contract.

#### ZOS

If you use zos, you will have the proxy and the contract in different directories.

Likely, you will use one of the proxy from https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos. Clone the `zos`, and install the dependencies:

```
git clone https://github.com/zeppelinos/zos
cd zos/packages/lib
npm install
rm contracts/mocks/WithConstructorImplementation.sol
```

Note: `contracts/mocks/WithConstructorImplementation.sol` must be removed as it contains a [name clash collision](https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki#keyerror-or-nonetype-error) with `contracts/mocks/Invalid.sol`

Then from your project directory:

```
slither-check-upgradeability . ContractName --proxy-filename /path/to/zos/packages/lib/ --proxy-name UpgradeabilityProxy
```

According to your setup, you might choose another proxy name than `UpgradeabilityProxy`.

## Checks Description

## Variables that should not be constant

### Configuration

- Check: `became-constant`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect state variables that should not be `constant̀`.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    uint variable1;
    uint variable2;
    uint variable3;
}

contract ContractV2{
    uint variable1;
    uint constant variable2;
    uint variable3;
}
```

Because `variable2` is now a `constant`, the storage location of `variable3` will be different.
As a result, `ContractV2` will have a corrupted storage layout.

### Recommendation

Do not make an existing state variable `constant`.

## Functions IDs collisions

### Configuration

- Check: `function-id-collision`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect function ID collision between the contract and the proxy.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    function gsf() public {
        // ...
    }
}

contract Proxy{
    function tgeo() public {
        // ...
    }
}
```

`Proxy.tgeo()` and `Contract.gsf()` have the same function ID (0x67e43e43).
As a result, `Proxy.tgeo()` will shadow Contract.gsf()`.

### Recommendation

Rename the function. Avoid public functions in the proxy.

## Functions shadowing

### Configuration

- Check: `function-shadowing`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect function shadowing between the contract and the proxy.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    function get() public {
        // ...
    }
}

contract Proxy{
    function get() public {
        // ...
    }
}
```

`Proxy.get` will shadow any call to `get()`. As a result `get()` is never executed in the logic contract and cannot be updated.

### Recommendation

Rename the function. Avoid public functions in the proxy.

## Initialize functions are not called

### Configuration

- Check: `missing-calls`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect missing calls to initialize functions.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Base{
    function initialize() public{
        ///
    }
}
contract Derived is Base{
    function initialize() public{
        ///
    }
}

```

`Derived.initialize` does not call `Base.initialize` leading the contract to not be correctly initialized.

### Recommendation

Ensure all the initialize functions are reached by the most derived initialize function.

## initializer() is not called

### Configuration

- Check: `missing-init-modifier`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect if `Initializable.initializer()` is called.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    function initialize() public{
        ///
    }
}

```

`initialize` should have the `initializer` modifier to prevent someone from initializing the contract multiple times.

### Recommendation

Use `Initializable.initializer()`.

## Initialize functions are called multiple times

### Configuration

- Check: `multiple-calls`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect multiple calls to a initialize function.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Base{
    function initialize(uint) public{
        ///
    }
}
contract Derived is Base{
    function initialize(uint a, uint b) public{
        initialize(a);
    }
}

contract DerivedDerived is Derived{
    function initialize() public{
        initialize(0);
        initialize(0, 1 );
    }
}

```

`Base.initialize(uint)` is called two times in `DerivedDerived.initialize` execution, leading to a potential corruption.

### Recommendation

Call only one time every initialize function.

## Incorrect variables with the v2

### Configuration

- Check: `order-vars-contracts`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect variables that are different between the original contract and the updated one.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    uint variable1;
}

contract ContractV2{
    address variable1;
}
```

`Contract` and `ContractV2` do not have the same storage layout. As a result the storage of both contracts can be corrupted.

### Recommendation

Respect the variable order of the original contract in the updated contract.

## Incorrect variables with the proxy

### Configuration

- Check: `order-vars-proxy`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect variables that are different between the contract and the proxy.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    uint variable1;
}

contract Proxy{
    address variable1;
}
```

`Contract` and `Proxy` do not have the same storage layout. As a result the storage of both contracts can be corrupted.

### Recommendation

Avoid variables in the proxy. If a variable is in the proxy, ensure it has the same layout than in the contract.

## State variable initialized

### Configuration

- Check: `variables-initialized`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect state variables that are initialized.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    uint variable = 10;
}
```

Using `Contract` will the delegatecall proxy pattern will lead `variable` to be 0 when called through the proxy.

### Recommendation

Using initialize functions to write initial values in state variables.

## Variables that should be constant

### Configuration

- Check: `were-constant`
- Severity: `High`

### Description

Detect state variables that should be `constant̀`.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    uint variable1;
    uint constant variable2;
    uint variable3;
}

contract ContractV2{
    uint variable1;
    uint variable2;
    uint variable3;
}
```

Because `variable2` is not anymore a `constant`, the storage location of `variable3` will be different.
As a result, `ContractV2` will have a corrupted storage layout.

### Recommendation

Do not remove `constant` from a state variables during an update.

## Extra variables in the proxy

### Configuration

- Check: `extra-vars-proxy`
- Severity: `Medium`

### Description

Detect variables that are in the proxy and not in the contract.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    uint variable1;
}

contract Proxy{
    uint variable1;
    uint variable2;
}
```

`Proxy` contains additional variables. A future update of `Contract` is likely to corrupt the proxy.

### Recommendation

Avoid variables in the proxy. If a variable is in the proxy, ensure it has the same layout than in the contract.

## Missing variables

### Configuration

- Check: `missing-variables`
- Severity: `Medium`

### Description

Detect variables that were present in the original contracts but are not in the updated one.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract V1{
    uint variable1;
    uint variable2;
}

contract V2{
    uint variable1;
}
```

The new version, `V2` does not contain `variable1`.
If a new variable is added in an update of `V2`, this variable will hold the latest value of `variable2` and
will be corrupted.

### Recommendation

Do not change the order of the state variables in the updated contract.

## Extra variables in the v2

### Configuration

- Check: `extra-vars-v2`
- Severity: `Informational`

### Description

Show new variables in the updated contract.

This finding does not have an immediate security impact and is informative.

### Exploit Scenario:

```solidity
contract Contract{
    uint variable1;
}

contract Proxy{
    uint variable1;
    uint variable2;
}
```

`Proxy` contains additional variables. A future update of `Contract` is likely to corrupt the proxy.

### Recommendation

Ensure that all the new variables are expected.

## Initializable is not inherited

### Configuration

- Check: `init-inherited`
- Severity: `Informational`

### Description

Detect if `Initializable` is inherited.

### Recommendation

Review manually the contract's initialization. Consider inheriting `Initializable`.

## Initializable is missing

### Configuration

- Check: `init-missing`
- Severity: `Informational`

### Description

Detect if a contract `Initializable` is present.

### Recommendation

Review manually the contract's initialization..
Consider using a `Initializable` contract to follow [standard practice](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/upgrades/2.7/writing-upgradeable).

## Initialize function

### Configuration

- Check: `initialize-target`
- Severity: `Informational`

### Description

Show the function that must be called at deployment.

This finding does not have an immediate security impact and is informative.

### Recommendation

Ensure that the function is called at deployment.

## initializer() is missing

### Configuration

- Check: `initializer-missing`
- Severity: `Informational`

### Description

Detect the lack of `Initializable.initializer()` modifier.

### Recommendation

Review manually the contract's initialization. Consider inheriting a `Initializable.initializer()` modifier.
